# Welcome to the README! 

Heyo!  This app is designed to be a simple baseline rails app to be used for implementing and evaluating various testing frameworks.  
Ultimately, this repo will be softlocked then forked for individual framework buildouts.  

The plan is currently for this app to hold examples of the following:
* Simple Math _(in progress)_
* Todo _(in progress)_
* TODO: _Idealy 2 others_
  
Thank you and godspeed.

Some of these I will add, and some I will omit:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* TODO: Deployment instructions

* Styling is Tailwind CSS
